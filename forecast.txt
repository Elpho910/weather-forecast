Issued Tuesday night at 10:00pm.

Weather Situation:
A cold front crosses over Tasmania, as associated low pressure system nears the west coast before slipping to the southwest of Tasmania. A cool westerly flow is expected to develop on Wednesday, as a high pressure system over inland Australia extends a ridge southwards over Tasmania into Thursday. The high centre is expected to move into the Tasman Sea on Friday, with the ridge to move to the east of the state.
